## My skills / expertise for crowdfightcovid19

Hi! This was the quickest way I could think of to put a summary of my skills and how I might be able to help with tasks for crowdfightcovid19. 

- Fiona O'Connell, undergrad CS major @ UChicago


### what I might be able to help with:

My programming strength is mostly in writing fairly low-level C code, but I have some familiarity with ML concepts and doing basic modeling/regressions in python. I'm probably best equipped to do the time consuming tasks dealing with data that don't require high levels of expertise, but I have some other skills that might be helpful (listed below). I'm more than happy to do tedious tasks for a good cause, and I enjoy figuring out how to communicate technical information to a non-technical audience. I'm also pretty good at copy-editing (and making writing sound good). 

### relevant experience and research teams I could (probably) connect someone to:

A few years back, I did a project modeling and predicting the number of influenza cases (in real time) by how often people were searching for flu related terms. This basically involved wrangling CDC flu incidence data and Google trends data, and then modeling in python using scikit learn, pandas, and other standard packages. I was mentored on this project by a small team of computational epidemiology researchers at Los Alamos National Labs (Reid Priedhorsky, Ashlynn Daughton, and Dave Osthus), and I could help make a connection there if someone needed!

That paper: 
[Estimating influenza incidence using search query deceptiveness and generalized ridge regression}(https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007165)

I also worked on a human computer interaction project on decision making with the GroupLens research group at the University of Minnesota, and could make a connection there as well. My experience from that involved manually going through and classifying and summarizing very large numbers of survey responses, designing survey questions, and editing/copy editing for technical and non technical audiences.
